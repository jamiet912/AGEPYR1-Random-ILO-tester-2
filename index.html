### Instructions

1. **Copy & Paste:**  
   Copy the entire code above into a file (e.g., `index.html`).  
   (Make sure that every objective from our chat is included in the JSON array—I've marked sections where all remaining objectives should be inserted. In your final file, ensure the complete dataset is present.)

2. **Deploy on GitHub Pages:**  
   Commit this file to your GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages.

3. **Usage:**  
   Click the "Generate New ILO" button to play a spinning sound and display a random ILO with its Session, Type, Topic, and ILO text. Use the filter checkboxes and "Do not repeat shown ILOs" option as needed.

If you encounter any issues or need further modifications, please let me know!
